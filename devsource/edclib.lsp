;;; Can't compile code to make licensing scheme secret.  Must use

;;; scheme.
;;;
;;; About version control
;;; 20170907 4.2.30 TGH See Git. Revamped bubble notes. Removed PGP. Reworked installer to replace AcadInst.exe. Improved CNM project mgt. Command spreadsheet audit/enhance.
;;; 20151001 4.2.29 TGH Added BIOS date registry location for Windows 10.
;;; 20150921 4.2.28 TGH Added LWP and LWPX.
;;; 20150916 4.2.27 TGH Fixed (vl-cmdf) incompatibility with v2015+ in lambdas.  Using (vl-cmdf-s).
;;; 20111021 4.2.21 TGH Made MSCRIPT use VBA only for releases 15 through 17 (2000 through 2009).  CNM QT had already been fixed that way.
;;; 20090923 4.2.20 TGH Changed authorization scheme in many ways to fix bugs.  Works with setcfg and still gets old stuff from registry.
;;; 20090923 4.2.19 TGH Changed authorization scheme (for Jared Cox) to use only HKCU section.
;;; 20090623 4.2.18 TGH Further fixed bug in CNM that caused no count (manual) notes to list quantities from other tabs in CTABONLY mode.  Also txtht didn't work after TITLE. 
;;; 20090622 4.2.17 TGH Fixed NOTEFND bug in CNM that caused notes to list even if not found if previously in table. 
;;; 20090309 4.2.16 TGH Fixed capitalization bug in CNM vars.  Vars remain case sensitive. 
;;; 20090205 4.2.15 TGH Fix bugs in (HCNM-PROJ) that were wiping Project Notes file clean if ProjectNotes= path was invalid. 
;;; 20081020 4.2.13 TGH Made CNM Bubbles follow a dimstyle stored in  CNM.INI. 
;;; 20080906 4.2.11 TGH Changed layers toward AIA/NCS.  Fixed CNM bubble hook bug. 
;;; 20080520 4.2.07 TGH Added non-nagging expiration mode and made nag mode a random 20% chance nag.
;;; 20080508 4.2.05 TGH Customized copy protection for XP, Vista, and ICAD.  Enhanced GETINTX, GETDISTX, and GETREALX.  Fixed CNM Table Grid INI var mismatch.
;;; 20080111 4.2.04 TGH Added phases A-Z to CNM for Danny Shahenian at DEI.
;;; 20071228 4.2.03 TGH Fixed a bug in timed trial reporting. Eased copy protection to use only (setcfg).
;;; 20070926 4.2.02 TGH Removed HKLM wssh `RegWrite and HKLM regwrite.  Swapped all to (setcfg) and (setenv) for Vista and ICAD compatibility.
;;; 20070818 4.2.01 TGH Fixed several bugs throughout incl stacl, layersav.  Made several globals local. Fixed HKLM wssh `RegWrite for Vista.
;;; 20050831 1.05   TGH Changed CNM to version 4.2.00.  Recompiled
